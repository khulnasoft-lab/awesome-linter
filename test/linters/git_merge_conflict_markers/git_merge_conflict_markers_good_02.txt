The "markers" above look like Git merge conflict markers,
though they aren't. Please find correct conflict markers
regexp at "/scripts/git-merge-conflict-markers.sh" file.

- Each marker should consist of exactly seven same chars.
- Opening marker is identified with '<' char.
- Closing marker is identified with '>' char.
- Divider marker is identified with '=' char.
- Opening marker (our version of the conflicting change) and
  closing marker (their version of the change) are followed
  by one space and identifier of the base or HEAD branch and
  identifier of the compared branch respectively.
- The line with the marker that divides our changes from the
  changes in the other branch consists of only divider char.
