      label: Are you resonably sure that it's a Awesome-linter issue, and not an issue related to a tool that Awesome-linter runs?
      description: |
        If you encounter a specific issue, ensure that the issue is about
        Awesome-linter, and not about a tool that Awesome-linter runs. For example,
        if a linter reports an unexpected or a surprising error, you may check
        if there are similar issues reported in that linter's issue tracker.
